# Ocelot

This package adds [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) support to Ocelot.

## How to install

Ocelot is designed to work with ASP.NET Core only and it targets `netstandard2.0`. This means it can be used anywhere `.NET Standard 2.0` is supported, including `.NET Core 2.1` and `.NET Framework 4.7.2` and up. [This](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) documentation may prove helpful when working out if Ocelot would be suitable for you.

Install Ocelot and it's dependencies using NuGet. 

`Install-Package Ocelot.Provider.Polly`

Or via the .NET Core CLI:

`dotnet add package Ocelot.Provider.Polly`

All versions can be found [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ocelot.Provider.Polly/)
